== Description ==

The main goal of this plugin - is to create an alternative way of multipart/form-data uploaders. Flexupload use Action Message Format (AMF) instead of usual POST data. It allows to use really cool features like simultaneous file upload, multithreading, resuming, compression and so onâ€¦

Advantages:

* Real multithreading and multiple file uploading
* From 50% to 300% faster upload speed (compared to usual uploaders)
* No upload size limit. Data transferred by small pieces in many threads, so no more server side upload limit.
* Full information - average and current speed, uploaded and total size and more.
* Size of swf file is only 95Kb!
* No more "HTTP error" and other upload problems

Just try It, You'll Love It!
